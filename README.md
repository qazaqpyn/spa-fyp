# Web-Based Data Visualization System

This project presents a robust and user-friendly web-based data visualization system. It empowers users to upload their datasets and visualize them on a map using kernel density visualization. The visualization is powered by [LIBKDV](https://github.com/libkdv/libkdv), a high-performance library for kernel density visualization.

## Features

-   **Data Upload:** Users can easily upload their datasets for visualization.
-   **Kernel Density Visualization:** The system uses LIBKDV to generate kernel density visualizations from the uploaded datasets.
-   **Interactive Interface:** An intuitive interface allows users to specify parameters for the visualization, providing a tailored user experience.
-   **Visualization Display:** Users can view the resulting visualization in a user-friendly format, aiding in data analysis and interpretation.

## Getting Started

To use the system, simply navigate to the web interface, upload your dataset, specify your parameters, and view your visualization.
